# FasterCard
Project for the 2022/2023 Web Systems Design and Architectures course of the master's degree in IT Engineering

The goal of the project was to develop a Webapp regarding the management of Credit Cards with 3 types of users:

Card Owner: Can check their credit and eventually download a PDF report with all their transactions
Merchant: Same operations as a card owner but can also do transactions
System Admin: Same operations as a merchant but can also create cards, register merchants and eventually block them
